To connect to an API folder that is located in another folder from your frontend folder using Pinia and Vue, you can use the Axios library to make HTTP requests to your API.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

Install the Axios library in your Vue project. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:
Copy code
npm install axios
Create a new JavaScript file in your frontend folder (e.g. api.js) and import the Axios library at the top of the file:
js
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';
Define a base URL for your API in the api.js file. This is the URL that will be used as the prefix for all of your API requests:
js
Copy code
const baseURL = 'http://localhost:3000/api'; // Replace with your API's base URL
Create a new instance of the Axios library and set the baseURL property to the base URL of your API:
js
Copy code
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: baseURL,
});
Define functions in the api.js file that make HTTP requests to your API. For example, you might have a function that fetches data from a specific endpoint:
js
Copy code
export async function fetchData() {
  const response = await api.get('/data'); // Replace with your API endpoint
  return response.data;
}
Import the api.js file in your Pinia store and use the defined functions to make requests to your API:
js
Copy code
import { createPinia } from 'pinia';
import { fetchData } from '../path/to/api.js';

const store = createPinia();

store.defineActions({
  async fetchApiData() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    // Do something with the data
  },
});
That's it! With these steps, you should be able to connect to your API folder located in another folder from your frontend folder using Pinia and Vue.











1 : Create an account on Daraja, and create an app, i.e either C2B API or Lipa Na MPesa API , or use you can assign both to the same app.

2 : Generate a token that will be used in every transaction in daraja to m-pesa. NB: This token expires after about 1 hour, and you have to re-generate a new one after that. For this case I do a cron job that generates another token after every 55 minutes

3 : If you are doing C2B, you have to register urls where the transaction detail are sent to.

4 : Happy coding, in this project we have the necessary methods implemented for interacting with daraja.
